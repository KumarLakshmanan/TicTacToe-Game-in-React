# TicTacToe Game in React Framework
<br/>
<p>
This is my Second Project with React. Last Day our team decided to created this XO game in Vanilla js and completed is succesfully (https://github.com/rasla-Bla3kg33K/tic-tac-toe-using-javascript). And I try to convert this game into React. Finally I finished this in 3 Hours

## Rules

  - Player 1 Named X, Player 2 name O
  - You didnot Change the Value of already filled box
  - you need to fill your name (X or O) is vertical, horizontal, diagonal lines
  - If both players didn't fill the box the Macth becomes tie
  - You can Reset the Board using `Reset Board` Button
